    <section class="Introduction">

        <!-- Introduction -->
        <section>
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                The Academic Planning Directorate at Walter Sisulu University plays a strategic and foundational role
                in shaping the academic landscape of the institution. As WSU strives toward its vision of being an
                impactful, technology-infused African university, Academic Planning ensures that academic offerings are
                aligned, compliant, relevant, and capable of supporting institutional excellence.
            </p>

            <p>
                In a rapidly evolving higher education environment, the need for effective academic planning, programme
                development, accreditation, and academic service delivery has never been more essential. Academic
                Planning
                provides the framework, oversight, and strategic guidance necessary for WSU to adapt, grow, and maintain
                academic integrity and quality.
            </p>

        <!-- Rationale -->
        <section>
            <h2>The Rationale for Academic Planning</h2>
            <p>
                Academic Planning plays a pivotal role in supporting WSU’s strategic direction and academic mission.
                Its work ensures that academic programmes, planning processes, and institutional compliance efforts
                are grounded in national policy frameworks and aligned with university priorities. The Directorate’s
                significance lies in its ability to guide sustainable academic growth, quality assurance, and
                institutional
                alignment.
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Academic Programmes as Strategic Assets:</strong> Academic Planning ensures that programmes
                    are designed, accredited, and monitored in accordance with national regulatory bodies such as DHET,
                    SAQA, and CHE.</li>

                <li><strong>Evidence-Based Academic Decision-Making:</strong> Through programme viability studies,
                    registration monitoring, and compliance assessments, the Directorate provides insights that guide
                    academic and institutional decision-making.</li>

                <li><strong>Enhancing Student Success:</strong> By ensuring programmes meet educational compliance and
                    notional hour standards, Academic Planning supports the delivery of quality learning experiences
                    that
                    contribute to student success.</li>

                <li><strong>Optimizing Academic Resource Allocation:</strong> The Directorate advises on programme
                    viability, alignment, and demand, ensuring that resources are allocated efficiently and sustainably.
                </li>

                <li><strong>Fostering Academic Excellence:</strong> Academic Planning contributes to curriculum quality,
                    programme reviews, and academic integrity to ensure continuous improvement in teaching and learning.
                </li>

                <li><strong>Strategic Planning and Accountability:</strong> Academic Planning participates in shaping
                    the
                    institutional academic plan, the Programme Qualification Mix (PQM), and compliance with national
                    regulations.</li>

                <li><strong>Institutional Collaboration:</strong> Working closely with faculties, directorates, and
                    external
                    stakeholders, the Directorate promotes transparency, alignment, and shared academic purpose.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                Academic Planning ensures that WSU’s academic enterprise remains responsive, compliant, innovative, and
                strategically aligned with the needs of its students, communities, and the broader higher education
                sector.
